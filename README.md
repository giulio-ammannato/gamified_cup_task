# Gamified Version of the Cup Task

This program is fully funtcioning prototype of a gamified version of the Cup Task (Levin & Hart,2003). It aims at assessing decision making in risky conditions. For more information regarding the cup task: http://www.sjdm.org/dmidi/Cups_Task.html.

The code is [licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/giulio-ammannato/gamified_cup_task/blob/main/LICENSE).

A compiled, running version of the game is available for Windows in the builds folder [here](https://github.com/giulio-ammannato/gamified_cup_task/tree/main/Builds). I've tested the game on Ubuntu as well but the  Linux compiled version exceed the 25MB limit.

This software was made using c# in Unity. If you want to use it check Unity's license page: https://support.unity.com/hc/en-us/categories/201268913-Licenses.

The software was last tested using Unity version 2018.3.3f1.

The game can be compiled and used on different platforms (i.e. PC, Mac, Linux). For a complete list of platform: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/BuildSettings.html.

# Credits

Some of the art assets used in this software were obtained from free online resources while others were provided by Unity. I did this work 5 years ago and I can't remember exactly from where I picked the art assets. However I did not make them and all credits are due to the authors. If you want to claim any of the artwork, please contact me and, given the right proofs of parenting, I will give credit to your work.

Thanks to [Viola Izzo](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Viola_Izzo), [Caterina Primi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Caterina_Primi2), [Marianna Donati](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maria_Donati2) and [Joshua Weller](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joshua_Weller) for the support in creating this prototype.

# Final note
I'm planning to write and release a detailed explenation of the code. For the moment it's just provided as it is. However it's commented in english.
